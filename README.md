# The-Museum-of-Modern-Art-MoMA-Collection-Data-Driven-Decision-Making
An applied analytics project end-to-end using MoMA Collection Datasets for Data-driven Decision Making. 

This project aims to 
(1) communicate insights clearly and professionally, 
(2) develop the ability to justify decisions using data, visualizations, and evidence
(3) demonstrate competency with SQL analytics, Power BI, and modern AI tools.


Our project analyzes the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection dataset, which comprises 157,630 accessioned artworks along with their associated metadata, including artist, title, medium, creation date, dimensions, and acquisition date.
The goal is to explore patterns in MoMA’s collecting behavior, understand trends in artistic mediums and artist representation over time, and identify potential gaps in the dataset (e.g., missing or non-curator-approved records). The project uses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights from the museum’s historical collection data
